#Welcome all to my hello-world repository!

#I have decided to take the plunge into Github and will be uploading many of my projects, some of them you may use for free and others are just for me. I'm still very much a noob so expect bad code and worse spelling along with very inappropriate variable naming, anything more is a bonus.
#
#I have been programming for about 4-5 years with experience using a number of languages including but not limited to:
#
#Language-------Level
#Python...........Pretty good
#C...................Amateur+
#C++...............Amateur+
#C#.................Amateur++
#Java..............Amateur++ 
#Javascript.....Beginner+
#Bash..............Beginner
#  
#I'm sure I will get much better over the years as I'm #keenaf and won't be slowing down until my brain gives up on me.
#I enjoy making games for Linux, Windows and Android as well as a number of utilities mainly to do with plumbing, my usual profession.
#If anyone would like to offer me a job as a software delevoper I would gladly take it, I may not have the GCSE's that most other developers have, however I have no problem with maths or thinking in a methodical and logical way, please do not underestimate me. 
#Anyway that's it for now, wish me luck!
